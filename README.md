# Predicting Cancer Types based on Genetics Expression
This report is part of the assignment for the Big Data course at the University of Toronto. 

For this project, I’ll be working on the “Gene expression cancer RNA-Seq Data Set” provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this dataset is to come up with a classification model to label the type of cancer cells based on the expression levels of their genomes. The problem is that the samples in this dataset has very high number of dimensions (over 20K). To combat this, I will be reducing dimension using projection method (or PCA). In terms of classifying the right type of tumor, I will be using traditional classifying methods available in the Azure Machine Learning toolkit. These can either be multi-class neural networks or logistic regression.
